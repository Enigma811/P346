Max displacement (Newton Raphson) (Tolerance 10^-3)

Initial guess for Newton Raphson = Random


For displacement x, force acting on the system is given by:
F(x) = F - x*exp(x)

F = 2.5 N

At max displacement, the net force on the system is zero. Thus, we have,

Max displacement of spring = 0.959 m
