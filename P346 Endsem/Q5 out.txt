1-D motion with drag (d^2y/dt^2 + gamma*(dy/dt) = g): RK4

gamma = 0.02 s^(-1)
g = 10 m/s^2

Precision: 10^-3

Initial conditions:
y(0) = 0 m, v(0) = 10 m/s

Equation of motion without air resistance:
y(t) = u(t)*t - 0.5*g*t^2

Thus, time of flight (without air resistance) = 2 s       (for y=0 in eq. of motion)

Max height (without air resistance) = 5.0 m       (attained at t=1, by symmetry)

Max height (with air resistance) = 4.936 m
