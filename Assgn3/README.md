The input (for each Q) is to be given as the augmented matrix A|B, where AX=B represents a set of linear equations in matrix form.
The matrix elements in the input file are to be written row wise, with next row in a new line. For e.g.
1 2 3 4
4 5 6 2
-9 -2.3 -1 5

This is a readable (as designed for this assgn) input for AX=B, where A is given by
1 2 3
4 5 6
-9 -2.3 -1

and B is given by
4
3
5

Note: The input may also be provided as the string of equations of the form 
ax + by + cz (+ ...) = d
ex + fy + gz (+ ...) = h
.
.
.
where, a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(....) are numbers.
